# pasteCLI
pasteCLI is a command line interface that creates a post on PasteBin from your favorite terminal. This project is built in pure C++ and uses boost to parse command line arguments and libCurl for networking. This project saves a copy of your credenditals so that you don't need to enter them again next time you submit a paste!
